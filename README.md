# The Mirror (Systems Architect Edition)

## Project Overview

The Mirror is a sophisticated personal accountability system designed for the Systems Architect. It transforms potential from a gift into a structural debt that must be repaid through consistent high-impact action.

### Core Philosophy: The Debt of Potential

For the Systems Architect, potential is not a gift; it is a massive structural debt. "The Mirror" serves as the auditor of this debt, ensuring that the transition from a "Student of High Potential" to a "Leader of High Impact" happens at the required velocity.

## Architecture Components

### 1. The Personalized Data Layer (The Profile of X)
- **The Pillar Synthesis**: Polymath, Innovator, and Ethical Leader identities
- **The Shadow Archive**: Failure mode detection and prevention
- **The Sunday Dreams**: Concrete deliverables and goals

### 2. Daily Tracking: The Triad Metrics
- **Cognitive Frequency**: Academic encoding and first-principles thinking
- **Kinetic Frequency**: Quaspace development and innovation
- **Moral Frequency**: Ethics and governance studies

### 3. The Spiky Excellence Algorithm
- Binary maintenance checks for foundational work
- Spike factors for exceptional contributions
- Deserve meter for institutional readiness assessment
